# Credit_Card_Fraud

Introduction:
In today's digital age, the rise of e-commerce has revolutionized business operations, allowing for increased sales and convenience. However, this growth comes hand in hand with the heightened risk of fraudulent activities and cyber threats. This case study delves into the realm of an e-commerce book store, a thriving platform that has witnessed substantial sales over the years. The objective here is to leverage transaction history data, specifically utilizing a publicly available dataset comprising anonymized real credit card transactions.

Challenge:
E-commerce's Achilles' heel lies in the vulnerability of credit card information. The exposure of 15 to 16-digit card numbers, coupled with security codes and expiration dates, creates an avenue for potential exploitation by malicious entities. The primary focus of this project revolves around distinguishing between genuine transactions from credit card owners and transactions involving stolen credit card details.

A Complex Imbalance:
One of the central challenges we face stems from the inherent nature of credit card transactions. A majority of these transactions are legitimate, making it arduous to uncover subtle patterns within the available data. Consequently, the dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, demanding the application of diverse sampling techniques and evaluation metrics.

The Scale of the Issue:
Statistics reveal that a mere 0.1% of online credit card transactions are identified as fraudulent. However, given the sheer volume of daily transactions, even this minuscule percentage amounts to substantial financial losses. To mitigate this challenge, our goal is to construct a robust classifier system using the provided dataset. This classifier will discern between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, classifying them as '1' and '0,' respectively.

Approach:
To address this intricate problem, we plan to adopt a multifaceted approach. We will develop a deep learning network and complement it with conventional machine learning algorithms such as the Random Forest. This hybrid strategy will allow us to leverage the strengths of both paradigms and enhance our chances of accurate fraud detection.

Conclusion:
In our pursuit of building a reliable credit card fraud detection system, we have explored the nuances of e-commerce transactions and the vulnerabilities they entail. The crux of our endeavor lies in creating a robust classifier capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, a task essential for safeguarding both customers and the e-commerce platform. Through the systematic deployment of deep learning and traditional machine learning models, we intend to enhance fraud detection rates and bolster the security of online financial transactions.
